After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>

    <h2 id="you">How to access and control your information</h2>
    <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations. We will respond to requests about this within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
    <h3>Your Choices:</h3>
    <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format. Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Service and using settings available within the Service or your account. Where the Service is administered for you by an administrator (see "<a href="#end_users">Notice to End Users</a>" below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your request. For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the <a href="#contact_us">Contact Us</a> section below to request assistance.</p>
    <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep. Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by enabling an integration, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted. If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>
    <p><strong>Access and update your information:</strong> The Service and related documentation gives you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account in the Service. You can update your profile information within your profile settings.</p>
    <p><strong>Deactivate membership to a team or organization:</strong> You or an administrator can deactivate your access to a team or organization. If you can deactivate your own access, that setting is available to you in your account settings. Otherwise, please contact your administrator. If you are an administrator and are unable to deactivate an account through your administrator settings, please contact TeamMood support. Please be aware that deactivating access to a team or organization does not delete your information from that team or organization; your information remains visible to other Service users based on your past participation within the Service. For more information on how to delete your information, see below.</p>
    <p><strong>Delete your information:</strong> the Service and related documentation gives you the possibility to delete certain information about you from within the Service. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p>
    <p><strong>Request that we stop using your information:</strong> In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don't have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Services account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place at the time. You can also opt-out of our use of your information for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is a delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honored or the dispute is resolved, provided your administrator does not object (where applicable). If you object to information about you being shared with a third-party app, please disable the app or contact your administrator to do so.</p>
    <p><strong>Opt out of communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, or by contacting us as provided below to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database. Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding the Service. Please note, you will continue to receive generic advertisement.</p>
    <p><strong>Turn off Cookie Controls:</strong> Relevant browser-based cookie controls are described in our <a href="/en/cookies-policy/">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Send "Do Not Track" Signals:</strong> Some browsers have incorporated "Do Not Track" (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, currently the Service does not respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.</p>
    <p><strong>Data portability:</strong> Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier). Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information, for anonymity reasons. Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information and the information you create on the Service under your sole control.</p>

    <h2 id="gdpr">Summary of Your Rights under GDPR</h2>
    <p>Under the GDPR, you have:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the right to request access to, deletion of or correction of your personal data held by Us; </li>
        <li>the right to complain to a supervisory authority;</li>
        <li>be informed of what data processing is taking place;</li>
        <li>the right to restrict processing;</li>
        <li>the right to data portability;</li>
        <li>object to processing of your personal data;</li>

    </ul>
    <p>To enforce any of the foregoing rights or if you have any other questions about the Service or this Privacy Policy, please <a href="#contact_us">contact us</a> using the details below.</p>

    <h2 id="other">Other important privacy information</h2>
    <h3 id="end_users">Notice to End Users</h3>
    <p>When the Service is made available to you through an organization (e.g. your employer), that organization is the administrator of the Service and is responsible for the end-users and/or Service sites over which it has control. If this is the case, please direct your data privacy questions to your administrator, as your use of the Service is subject to that organization's policies. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of an administrator's organization, which may be different than this policy.Even if the Service are not currently administered to you by an organization, if you are a member of a team administered by an organization, or if you use an email address provided by an organization (such as your work email address) to access the Service, then the administrator of that team or the owner of the domain associated with your organizational email address (e.g. your employer) may assert administrative control over your account and use of the Service at a later date. You will be notified if this happens. Team and organization administrators are able to restrict your access to and privileges within the respective team or organization the administrator controls. In some cases, team or organization administrators can also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Service or your account;</li>
        <li>change your account information, including profile information or the email address associated with your account;</li>
        <li>access information in and about your account;</li>
        <li>access or retain information stored as part of your account; and</li>
        <li>enable or disable third-party apps, or other integrations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you do not want an administrator to be able to assert control over your account or use of the Service, you should deactivate your membership with the relevant team or organization or remove any email addresses containing a domain owned or controlled by the administrator entirely from your account. Once an administrator asserts control over your account or use of the Service, you may no longer be able to withdraw membership or change the email address associated with your account without administrator approval.</p>
    <p>Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator&rsquo;s organizational policies for more information.</p>
    <h3>Our policy towards children</h3>
    <p>the Service is not directed to individuals under 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete such information. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, please contact our support services.</p>
    <h3>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review. We encourage you to review our privacy policy whenever you use the Service to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, you will need to stop using the Service and deactivate your account(s), as outlined above.</p>
