    <h1>Keeping Your Data Secure</h1>

    <p>We do our best to actively provide a strong level of security. This page explains how.</p>

    <p>Please note that we're humans though — and that security is an ever-going chasing game, with several high profile websites hacked every year.</p>

    <p>Think you found an issue? We're more than welcoming your feedback - please <a href="#Reporting+Incidents">report an incident</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="Up-To-Date+Infrastructure+And+Patches">Up-To-Date Infrastructure And Patches</h2>

    <p>We keep our infrastructure updated with scheduled security maintenance updates, as well as applying any patches that are recommended to be rolled out immediately. We rely on a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/policy/security">security-minded hosting provider</a> which provides easy-to-apply security updates on all infrastructure components.</p>

    <p>Similarly, we patch our application code very quickly when vulnerabilities are discovered. We rely on internal and external tools to audit our app code and behaviour.</p>

    <h2 id="Proactive+Monitoring">Proactive Monitoring</h2>

    <p>We use redundant, world-wide monitoring services to monitor TeamMood’s infrastructure 24x7x365. Any errors or other abnormalities trigger automatic alarms and we pro-actively work on fixing any issues detected. If we detect issues with your account, we will contact the account owner by email.</p>

    <h2 id="Protection+Against+Data+Loss">Protection Against Data Loss</h2>

    <p>We make daily backups of TeamMood's database as well as regular full images (snapshots) of TeamMood's servers.</p>

    <p>The backups are saved encrypted and regularly tested for integrity.</p>

    <p>We have the required infrastructure to rebuild a fully running service based on those backups very quickly.</p>

    <h2 id="Your+Credit+Card+Data+Is+Safe">Your Credit Card Data Is Safe</h2>

    <p>We do not store your billing information on our servers.</p>

    <p>Your credit card data is directly and securely submitted to a leading, full PCI-compliant payment gateway provider (<a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>), using their JavaScript API.</p>

    <h2 id="Reporting+Incidents">Reporting Incidents</h2>

    <p>Have you noticed abuse, misuse, or experienced an incident with your account or have you identified a vulnerability in our systems?</p>

    <p>We'll take your feedback very seriously: email <a href="mailto:contact@teammood.com">contact@teammood.com</a>. We <strong>will reply</strong> in all cases and <strong>work with you to handle the situation</strong>.</p>

    <h2 id="Questions">Questions?</h2>
