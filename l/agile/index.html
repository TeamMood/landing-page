                    <h3>Open up conversations</h3>
                    <p>Transparency is key. Everyone in the team sees the data, and talk about it. As a manager, take part to those conversations to better understand what is going on.</p>

                    <h3>Uncover hidden issues</h3>
                    <p>Thanks to anonymity, get an honest feedback from your teammates. It's easier for someone to say something through TeamMood instead of going to tell in person.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to the daily survey, discover an issue quickly, and address it without waiting, before the issue becomes out of control.</p>
