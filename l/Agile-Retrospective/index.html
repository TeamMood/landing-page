text: <p>If you run Agile retrospectives every two weeks or every month, it’s hard to remember everything that happened during this timeframe. You usually end up focusing on the last few days.</p><p>With TeamMood, you can have access to daily feedback, ideas and comments from your team members during the whole period. It works as a team’s diary. Using this data during your retrospectives helps you get a comprehensive view of what happened, and enriches or starts interesting discussions with your teammates.</p>
