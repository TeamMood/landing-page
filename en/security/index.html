            <h1>Keeping Your Data Secure</h1>
            <p>We do our best to actively provide a strong level of security.</p>
            <p>Please note that we're humans though — and that security is an ever-going chasing game, with several high profile websites hacked every year.</p>
            <p>Think you found an issue? We're more than welcoming your feedback - please <a href="#Reporting+Incidents">report an incident</a>.</p>

                <p>We keep our infrastructure updated with scheduled security maintenance updates, as well as applying any patches that are recommended to be rolled out immediately. We rely on a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/policy/security">security-minded hosting provider</a> which provides easy-to-apply security updates on all infrastructure components.</p>
                <p>Similarly, we patch our application code very quickly when vulnerabilities are discovered. We rely on internal and external tools to audit our app code and behaviour.</p>

If we detect issues with your account, we will contact the account owner by email.</p>

                <p>Cyber Essentials is a UK Government-backed scheme to help businesses and organisations protect themselves from cyber-attacks, particularly from hacking, phishing and password guessing.</p>
                <p>Attaining certification in Cyber Essentials involves reviewing all our in-house and external systems to ensure that they are locked down and secured from intrusion – this can be as simple as enforcing complex passwords for user accounts. It also lays down guidelines for best practice when it comes to software provision and administration, such as ensuring that only relevant users and devices are allowed to access our software and data.</p>
