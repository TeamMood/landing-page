        <h1>Track the most important KPI of your team: mood</h1>
        <p class="homepage-subtitle">TeamMood allows you to track the mood of your team with a Niko-Niko calendar. Perfect for Scrum Masters and team leaders to get daily feedback from teammates or to know their mood even if they work remotely.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">Why tracking mood is better than other KPIs?</h2>
        <p>There are plenty of KPIs you can use to measure how well your team is doing: productivity, lead time, bugs, etc.</p>
        <p>But your teammates might feel the pressure to always do more to improve KPIs and it's always going to lead to stress.</p>
        <p>That's why we think the best KPI to measure how well your team is doing is actually its mood.</p>
        <p>A great team is composed of happy people. If their wellness is taken seriously, the team will be more productive, produce less bugs, be on time, etc. And you won't even have to track these KPIs to know it.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">What is a Niko-Niko calendar?</h2>
        <p>It‚Äôs a simple calendar with everybody‚Äôs name on it. At the end of the day, each team member is invited to share their mood of the day, sticking smilies happy üòÑ, straight üò¨ or frowning üôÅ or color stickers on it. That‚Äôs actually where its name comes from: Niko means smile in Japanese.</p>
        <p>We translated this calendar into an online application so you could track mood even more easily and quickly.</p>

                <h3>Effortless moods</h3>
                <p>Writing a comment every day can quickly become boring for your teammates. With moods, a single click allows you to get useful information on their wellness and keep boredom out for longer.</p>

                <h3>Feedback history at a glance</h3>
                <p>You need a clean and clear overview to quickly see the mood of your team. That's why we made a special view based on niko-niko calendar and Agile retrospective practices so you can track moods in just one moment and see how wellness improves over time.</p>

                <p>It's next to impossible to get honest feedback from teammates if what they say is identifiable. Feedback in TeamMood is completely anonymous.</p>
