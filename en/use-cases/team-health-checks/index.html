        <p>The purpose of conducting team health checks is to identify team strengths, areas for improvement, and cultivate open communication and collaboration.</p>
        <p>But it’s easier said than done:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="pb-2">Getting everyone to participate genuinely is a challenge</li>
            <li class="pb-2">Employee feedback forms are too infrequent</li>
            <li>It’s impossible to track data over time without the right tools</li>
        </ul>
