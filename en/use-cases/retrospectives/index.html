                <h3 class="mb-1">Feedback history to plan retrospectives</h3>
                <p>It’s hard to remember everything that happened during a sprint or cycle which makes retrospectives often long and disorganized.</p>
                <p>With TeamMood, you get feedback during the whole timeframe.</p>
                <p>Retrospectives can be properly planned and organized and will provide more insights in a shorter time.</p>

                <p>Teammates don’t give honest feedback if they fear it will be used against them.</p>
                <p>And without good feedback, retrospectives won’t bear any fruit.</p>
                <p>TeamMood makes all feedback anonymous which paves the way for constructive criticism and feedback in a safe and trusted environment.</p>
