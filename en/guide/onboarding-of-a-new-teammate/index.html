                    <li>Introduce them to the team, tools, processes, and communication methods</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Onboarding new teammates is challenging, and you will always have hurdles to overcome. Some will clear as day, while others will stay hidden.</p>

                        <p>A new addition to the team will often change the dynamic of the team. Checking in on the new member is important, but so is on others members.</p>
                        <p>Because feedback in TeamMood is anonymous, you are forced to check everyone's feedback anyway.</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Analyze feedback without bias</h2>
                <p>Don't assume it is from the new member if you see an outlier mood as soon as the new member arrives. It could be from another teammate. When you deal with it, be open to the possibility it could be anyone.</p>
                <p>But sometimes, even if it's anonymous, the written comment might give away the new member. Still, try to act as if you didn't know.</p>
