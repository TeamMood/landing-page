        <h2>The easiest and fastest tool you will find</h2>
        <p class="h2-subtitle pb-3">Managing a team is time-consuming and you've got better things to do than configuring a tool for hours before it might start to be useful. When you sign up to TeamMood, you can actually start gathering your teammates' feelings in just a few minutes.</p>
