        <h1>Anonymous feedback</h1>
        <h2>Create a safe environment with anonymous feedback</h2>

        <h3>Why anonymity is key?</h3>
        <p>It's next to impossible to get honest feedback from teammates if what they say is identifiable.</p>
        <p>If you ask for feedback face-to-face with all the team present, you might not get the right answer.</p>
        <p>And if you use tools not adapted to the task, like whiteboards, feedback will also be identifiable. And it will be difficult to extract insights from it.</p>
        <p>Anonymity is crucial for quality feedback and in turn is essential to build great team leadership.</p>
