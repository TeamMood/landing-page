            Stéphane is the CEO of Fioulmarket, a subsidiary of the Total Group that offers online sales of heating oil to consumers. The startup uses TeamMood to gauge satisfaction levels from its I.T. and digital marketing teams to client services and even within its steering committee.

        <h3 class="success-text-yellow">The context</h3>
        <p>
            Fioulmarket, a startup created by Total, was launched in 2012. One of the  most important challenge for Stéphane was to imbue his team with a special  corporate culture, which was what prompted him to give TeamMood a try.  The application simplicity and the results it yielded did the rest.

        <h3 class="success-text-yellow">Contribute to creating a corporate culture</h3>
        <p>At Fioulmarket, the average age is around 30. The team needs to be agile,  responsive and dynamic to attract and hold onto talent. As for most  startups, recruitment is a key issue.</p>
        <p>“We devote a lot of energy to recruitment. We want to foster a corporate  culture that allows everyone to feel at home.”</p>
        <p>Fioulmarket's approach to corporate culture and team motivation involves  listening to employees' opinions, sharing this feedback and acting on it  when necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="success-blocquote success-text-yellow">“TeamMood allows us to pick up on subtle signs and to get feedback on team morale.”</p>

    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-yellow">Measuring team morale</h3>
        <p>“TeamMood serves as a yardstick for team morale and satisfaction”.</p>
        <p>By going beyond the results for any given day, managers can track  overarching trends to pick up on early warning signs of any team crises or,  for example, to gauge employee satisfaction “when an eagerly awaited  applicant is finally hired”. </p>
        <p>The results are shared with the managers and occasionally presented to  employees. For Stéphane, “it's interesting to see the mirror effect it has on  the teams.” </p>
    </div>
    <div class="row my-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-yellow">Managing millennials more effectively</h3>
        <p>For Stéphane, “management today is becoming increasingly complex”. With  generation Y, and more recently generation Z, joining the corporate ranks,  we're witnessing a shift in employee expectations. Work needs to be a  rewarding source of fulfilment and personal development. It's important for  management to be receptive and adapt to individual expectations.</p>
        <p>TeamMood helps local managers to face the challenges presented by this  changing landscape. A daily survey allows managers to track changes in  their teams' mood and to respond quickly. </p>
        <p>“TeamMood allows us to be receptive and to foster team wellbeing.” </p>
