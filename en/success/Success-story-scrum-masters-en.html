            <p class="text-justify">
            Jean-Baptiste is part of the management team in charge of an e-commerce platform at a French retail outfit. In keeping with their agile approach, he decided to use TeamMood to get a daily reading of team morale.

            <p class="text-justify">
                One  of  his  key  challenges  relates  to  the  distributed  nature  of  his  team.  To foster communication and collaboration, the teams are using tools like Slack and JIRA, but those platforms don’t do all that much to develop empathy nor give  a  visual  representation  of  the  heartbeat  of  the  team  -  like  meeting around the watercooler would (one can only do so much with emoticons!)

        <h3>To help Scrum Masters manage their teams</h3>
        <p>When managing a team of Scrum Masters, how can you know if they're  effective at their jobs? Jean-Baptiste uses TeamMood to measure happiness  at work on a day-to-day basis. A summary of each team's results is sent to  their respective Scrum Masters every week.</p>
        <p>PFor Jean-Baptiste, what's crucial with TeamMood is how the results are  used. “I don't just look at the score for each team. What's more important is  to see how a Scrum Master responds and helps the team navigate their way  through any problems that arise.”</p>
        <p>Certain Scrum Masters even keep their team's mood posted on their screen  display so they can take immediate action in the face of changes in mood.</p>

    <p class="success-blocquote success-text-azur">“TeamMood provides me with team feedback and allows me to defend their interests.”

    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3>Looking out for the team</h3>
        <p>With TeamMood, Jean-Baptiste can get a quantitative and objective reading  of team satisfaction (or dissatisfaction). </p>
        <p>For instance, when the building management service decided to stop having  a food truck come at lunchtime each day, the reaction was immediate and  unanimous (“Hands off my food truck”). TeamMood provided the objective  argument necessary to overturn the decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3>Communicate information and lead teams</h3>
        <p>“We put a rule in place: if a problem arises, we ask the person concerned to  leave a comment so we can find out what caused it. How we process a low score due to bad weather will be different to how we tackle a problem with a work-related cause.” </p>
        <p>TeamMood is a forum for exchanging and communicating information and it  also contributes to a good work atmosphere. “Following a sports event at  work, employees exchange good-natured banter in the comments.”</p>
