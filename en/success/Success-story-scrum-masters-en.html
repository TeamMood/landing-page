            Jean-Baptiste is part of the management team in charge of an e-commerce platform at a French retail outfit. In keeping with their agile approach, he decided
            to use TeamMood to get a daily reading of team morale.

        <h3 class="success-text-azur">The context</h3>
        <p>
            Jean-Baptiste started using TeamMood as a management tool for Scrum  Masters. The company was already carrying out team surveys on a yearly  and trimestrial basis but he wanted a solution that would give him daily  results. TeamMood was gradually rolled out to the rest of the company at the  changeover of a Scrum Master.

        <h3 class="success-text-azur">To help Scrum Masters manage their teams</h3>
        <p>When managing a team of Scrum Masters, how can you know if they're  effective at their jobs? Jean-Baptiste uses TeamMood to measure happiness  at work on a day-to-day basis. A summary of each team's results is sent to  their respective Scrum Masters every week.</p>
        <p>PFor Jean-Baptiste, what's crucial with TeamMood is how the results are  used. “I don't just look at the score for each team. What's more important is  to see how a Scrum Master responds and helps the team navigate their way  through any problems that arise.”</p>
        <p>Certain Scrum Masters even keep their team's mood posted on their screen  display so they can take immediate action in the face of changes in mood.</p>

    <p class="success-blocquote success-text-azur">“TeamMood provides me with team feedback and allows me to defend their interests.”
    </p>

    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-azur">Looking out for the team</h3>
        <p>With TeamMood, Jean-Baptiste can get a quantitative and objective reading  of team satisfaction (or dissatisfaction). </p>
        <p>For instance, when the building management service decided to stop having  a food truck come at lunchtime each day, the reaction was immediate and  unanimous (“Hands off my food truck”). TeamMood provided the objective  argument necessary to overturn the decision.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-azur">Communicate information and lead teams</h3>
        <p>“We put a rule in place: if a problem arises, we ask the person concerned to  leave a comment so we can find out what caused it. How we process a low score due to bad weather will be different to how we tackle a problem with a work-related cause.” </p>
        <p>TeamMood is a forum for exchanging and communicating information and it  also contributes to a good work atmosphere. “Following a sports event at  work, employees exchange good-natured banter in the comments.”</p>

<p class="success-blocquote success-text-azur">“TeamMood gives me access to information that wouldn't otherwise be shared.”</p>
