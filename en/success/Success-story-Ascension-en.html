            Patrick is mission initiatives manager for Ascension Ministry Service Center. The subsidiary is in charge of all shared services for Ascension, a non-profit healthcare organization employing over 150,000 people across the United States and providing more than $1.8 billion in care of persons living in poverty.

        <h3 class="success-text-purple">The situation</h3>
        <p>
            One of Patrick’s key challenges relates to the engagement of the associates of Ascension Ministry Service Center. Indeed, Ascension being a faith-based company, associates entered the company with a lot of expectations, that managers had a hard time to meet without having concrete feedback from their team members. As a result, teams were suffering from a lack of employee engagement and high turnover.

        <h3 class="success-text-purple">Provide a tool for managers</h3>
        <p>According to Patrick, managers were struggling with employee engagement: they were facing a high turnover and negative feedback from associates, and only had performance reviews to handle them.</p>
        <p>“We already had a survey once every two weeks coming from the headquarters, but it wasn't enough. We needed a tool to really know how the associates were feeling daily.”</p>
        <p>Using TeamMood allowed managers to <strong>re-engage with associates</strong>. They look at grades and comments, and are able to <strong>pinpoint efforts to a specific team.</strong> </p>
    </div>

    <p class="success-blocquote success-text-purple">“TeamMood helps us measure the temperature of our associates.”</p>

    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-purple">Meet employee expectations</h3>
        <p>Maybe due to the non-profit status of the company or even the fact that it’s faith-based, or maybe just because millennials’ expectations from work are higher than they used to be, managers were facing disatisfaction from their teams.</p>
        <p>TeamMood gave them the opportunity to <strong>speak up and be heard</strong>. “Not everyone participates daily – we have around 40 to 45% participation among associates. But those who do participate get feedback and see the benefit.”</p>
        <p>The company’s results (including the CEO’s) are shared in an ‘associate experience’ meeting every 2 weeks. And the teams’ feeling is now displayed on flat screens everywhere in the company, along with upcoming events, performance etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-purple">Improve employee engagement</h3>
        <p>According to Patrick, “TeamMood is very useful for employee engagement. Nowadays, managers and supervisors are busy. Having a tool to help them know how their team is feeling is very helpful.”</p>
        <p>Thanks to TeamMood, they were able to <strong>bring turnover down by 6% in just 6 months, and by 13% overall</strong>. The participation to the daily survey has also increased as associates witnessed the results.</p>
