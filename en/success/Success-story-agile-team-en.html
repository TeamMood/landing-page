            <h2>About Andy</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
            Andy  is  an Agile  Coach  and  Senior  Scrum  Master  at  a Fortune   50   company.   He   serves   multiple   cross-functional  software  development  teams  (composed  of engineers,  UI/UX  designers,  product  owners,  testers, etc ...) who are building a national ecommerce platform.

            <h2>The situation</h2>
            <p class="text-justify">
                One  of  his  key  challenges  relates  to  the  distributed  nature  of  his  team.  To foster communication and collaboration, the teams are using tools like Slack and JIRA, but those platforms don’t do all that much to develop empathy nor give  a  visual  representation  of  the  heartbeat  of  the  team  -  like  meeting around the watercooler would (one can only do so much with emoticons!)

        <h2>How does Andy use TeamMood?</h2>
        <p><span class="success-number success-bg-blue">1</span>
            To  gain  insights  on  his  teams’  moods  and  feelings  on  a  daily  basis and to spot trends over time
        </p>
        <p><span class="success-number success-bg-blue">2</span>
            To gather feedback via comments on a contemporaneous basis
        </p>
        <p><span class="success-number success-bg-blue">3</span>
            To get a leading indicator of team performance

        <h3>Gain Insights on Teams’ Mood</h3>
        <p>“Some tools are designed to monitor team health quarterly or annually, but I was looking for a real-time indicator, and I found TeamMood.”</p>
        <p>“TeamMood makes it easy to gather data daily, and by using tags, drill down to specific functions or roles for a large team. And even track multiple teams. And then I can visualize trends over time and identify inflexion points.”</p>
        <p>“Seeing the pulse of the teams with such clarity gives me the opportunity to be a better coach - responding in near real time.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3>Gather Feedback</h3>
        <p>TeamMood not only provides insights into the mood of a team, it also gives the   opportunity   for   each   teammate   to   share   his   or   her   comments contemporaneously.</p>
        <p>“When  individual  team  members  are  willing  to  share  anonymously  what makes  them  happy  and  sad,  the  whole  team  can  benefit.  I’ll  tap  into  the comments  when  designing  an  upcoming  retrospective.  And  as  a  team  we can  discuss  making  sure  we  don’t  lose  the  elements  that  contribute  to happiness, and that we strive to reduce or eliminate that things that make us sad.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3>Foreseeing Outcomes</h3>
        <p>According  to Andy,  “a  team’s  mood  is  a  leading  indicator  of  what’s  going  to happen  soon. A  happy  team  is  an  engaged,  performing  team.  Such  a  team creates  better  solutions,  with  higher  quality  than  a  consistently  unhappy team.  Better  delivery  results  in  happier  customers.  And  that  yields  happier stakeholders.”</p>
        <p>“On the other hand, if the mood of the team is dropping, I can be pretty sure that  without  some  intervention  a  drop  in  productivity  will  follow.  Seeing  a downward trend gives me the opportunity to respond proactively.”</p>
        <p>Keeping  track  of  the  team’s  health  is  especially  vital  for  an agile  team,  for which  each  day  can  be  decisive,  and  a  team’s  progress  toward  their  sprint goals depends on each and everyone’s collective contribution. “Is it time for a happy hour mid sprint? Or an hour break for some serious play-time? With TeamMood it’s easy for a scrum master to know!” </p>

        <h3>Healthy Agile Teams</h3>
        <p>“A lot of companies experiment with ways of measuring and visualizing how their  teams  are  doing  (KPI’s,  ROV’s,  NPS,  etc.,)  looking  for  areas  where there  are  opportunities  for  improvement.  The  general  idea  being  you  can’t improve  what  you  don’t  measure.  And  without  some  sort  of  systemic approach  with  clear  visualization  –  things  would  very  much  be  a  guessing game. TeamMood provides just that.”</p>
