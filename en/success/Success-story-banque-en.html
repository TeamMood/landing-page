            Guillaume is in charge of the Agile Center of Excellence of the I.T. department at a major French bank. He also takes care of the digital lab, which tests new tools and practices for the department’s software development team.

        <h3 class="success-text-purple">Background</h3>
        <p>
            Guillaume started using TeamMood on a key digital lab project. Familiar with  the Niko-niko calendar, he was looking for a digital tool that would allow him  to apply the same approach but for a cross-functional, cross-site team.

        <h3 class="success-text-purple">To gauge morale and stress levels within the team</h3>
        <p>The decision to use TeamMood came from a strong desire to get a reading  on team morale. “Right from the beginning, everyone was game to  participate”. </p>
        <p>Guillaume wanted to be sure that management’s close monitoring of the  project didn’t have a negative impact on the team.</p>
        <p>With team members working three days a week on-site and two days  remotely or from their respective sites, we needed a tool that would work  both in-house and remotely”: <strong>a digital Niko-Niko calendar</strong>.</p>
        <p>“And since it works through email and is Slack integrated, TeamMood was  really easy to use.”</p>
    </div>

    <p class="success-blocquote success-text-purple">“TeamMood allows me to gauge the team’s well being and improve the workday of each team member.” </p>

    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-purple">Agile team management</h3>
        <p>In each morning meeting, keeping track of agile methods, Guillaume  displayed TeamMood results from the previous day, the average, and the  trend over the previous weeks. </p>
        <p>“During our daily meeting, team members could share their thoughts and  explain low ratings. TeamMood provided employees with the opportunity to  speak up and got a dialogue going within the team.”</p>
        <p>TeamMood also provided a reading of teams’ stress levels at the end of a  sprint, and revealed that they didn’t increase much.</p>
        <p>“We’ve kept using TeamMood even after finishing the project. It’s having a  positive effect on everyone.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="row mt-5">
        <h3 class="success-text-purple">To improve retrospectives</h3>
        <p>In the aim of ongoing improvement, TeamMood was also useful for  retrospectives after each sprint. The results provided a basis for discussion  to weed out problems and work together to find a solution.</p>
        <p>“In particular, we noticed that developers were affected by changes in project  direction but product owners, who knew in advance, were much less  affected. That’s why we decided to inform the developers of these kinds of  changes earlier so as they could feel more involved and get into the team  spirit.” </p>

<p class="success-blocquote success-text-purple">“TeamMood’s strength is that it helps power a continuous cycle of improvement.”</p>
