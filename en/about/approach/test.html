        <h1>Improving wellness in organizations with a bottom-up approach</h1>
        <p>Changes that are forced are always going to create friction. Taking a bottom-up approach to wellness is the key to unlocking team synergy.</p>
        <p>We believe wellness can't be forced. Each team needs to do what works for them and improve at their own pace with the tools most adapted to them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Teammates, not employees. </strong>Managers are not the boss of the team, they are the leader. They need to treat teammates fairly and help them realize their potential.</li>
            <li><strong>Wellness is built on confidence. </strong>And confidence requires communication to dissipate any doubts.</li>
            <li><strong>Communication will defuse conflicts. </strong>But it needs to work both ways. The manager needs to listen to their teammates and have empathy to truly listen to them. No bias is permitted.</li>
            <li><strong>No micromanagement. </strong>It creates a stress environment for teammates which is the opposite of wellness. Team empowerment is the goal we must strive on.</li>
            <li><strong>We don't like to talk about performance, productivity, or optimization. </strong>Teammates are not resources, they are human beings.</li>
            <li><strong>Tools don't replace good practices. </strong>TeamMood will only give you the insights you need to better understand your team, but it's up to you to act correctly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How TeamMood started?</h3>
        <div  class="col-md-6 text-center p-2">

        <div class="col-md-6 mt-2">
            <p>TeamMood was imagined and initially created by Nicolas Deverge. As an Agile Coach, Nicolas helped a lot of companies on the Agile path. He realized that there are a lot of unhappy people in the workplace. He was (and still is) convinced that managers are the key to a better workplace.</p>
            <p>Nicolas bootstrapped TeamMood and is profitable since 2018. </p>
            <p class="text-primary">We are proud that hundreads of teams are using TeamMood for a better human listening and collaboration</p>
            <p class="text-light">He wanted the freedom to run his business independently and make time to spend with his family.</p>
            <p class="text-light">He'd surrounding himself with freelance experts on the specific areas he needs help with, to continue with the organic growth of the company.</p>

        <h3>Freedom and work-life balance leads to wellness</h3>

        <div class="col-md-6 mt-2">
            <p>We believe TeamMood can enable managers to change their minds, become real team leaders and give more freedom to their teammates.</p>
            <p>Working remotely is becoming the norm in many sectors and more people are realizing the need for work-life balance.</p>
            <p>More freedom and a better work-life balance inevitably leads to wellness. But choices need to be made.</p>
            <p>At TeamMood, we fix our own objectives and deadlines to be reasonable. This resulted in learning how to say ‚Äúno‚Äù and prioritizing constantly.</p>
            <p>We always wonder what is most important for our clients and for us, and this led to very positive consequences.</p>

            <p>When we started TeamMood, we had no idea where it would lead us. So we implemented the Lean methodology to learn from our potential users.</p>
            <p>We don‚Äôt have the answers. Our users do!</p>
            <p>This attitude also impacts our relationships with our clients. We don‚Äôt want to act serious or complicate things, just to look professional. We act naturally, we are all humans after all!</p>
            <p>Our clients usually appreciate this personal touch. And those who don‚Äôt, we don‚Äôt really want to work with them.</p>

        <h3>What values do we carry?</h3>
        <div class="col-md-6 text-center p-2">

            <p>At TeamMood, trust and communication are at the heart of professional relations, everyone knows what they have to do and can organize themselves freely to have the best balance in life.</p>
            <p>Thus, working time arrangements allow TeamMood employees to easily participate in family or sports activities (accompaniment to school outings for example), as well as to contribute to associative projects that are close to their hearts (repair caf√©, community Gardens, awareness workshops, etc.).</p>
            <p>This chosen flexibility enriches the exchanges and reflections on our daily work. Currently, these activities focus mainly on social ties and ecology and the TeamMood team has been in a process of sobriety for several years.</p>

            <p>There are no gadgets here, the computer equipment is kept to a minimum allowing you to work properly (a computer with a screen, wifi and that's it!).
            <p>The lifespan of the equipment is extended to the maximum and reconditioned is preferred as far as possible.</p>
            <p>The core TeamMood team is made up of 2 employees. We mainly work remotely except for one day a week. We then find ourselves in shared workspaces and favor the train for these journeys.</p>
            <p>For daily exchanges, the telephone is preferred to video, except for specific needs.</p>

            <p>On the design side, the TeamMood website was recently remodeled (2022) taking into account the eco-design recommendations given by WebVert to limit its energy impact.</p>
            <p>Regarding the application, we try to limit the functionalities to their real usefulness in a process of responding to the needs of users with minimalism. </p>
            <p>If a feature isn't used, don't keep it "just in case", we'll just reprocess it.</p>
            <p> The optimization of the application is also part of the recurring discussions (what technical choices? "refactoring"...).</p>

            <p>We want to do more.
                The question arose of how to contribute more to the ecological and social transition that we deem necessary.
                We wanted the type of initiatives carried out individually to have a collective meaning via TeamMood.</p>
            <p>Through the app? Would that perhaps take us too far away from our core business?
               Which initiative would be the most relevant?</p>
            <p>We therefore decided that in addition to the time freed up to get involved in associations for each employee,
                TeamMood would contribute financially to support actions in favor of the preservation of the environment.</p>
            <p>As soon as we can, we will communicate these actions more precisely in our blog.</p>
