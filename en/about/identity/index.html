        <h1>The way we work reflects our ideas about work and life</h1>
        <p>Through our way of working, we hope to show that it is possible to have another approach to work and to find a better balance between the different aspects of our lives. At a time when the meaning of work is a growing subject, we seek to contribute at our level to a better society, more respectful of people and the environment.</p>

            <p>At TeamMood, trust and communication are at the heart of professional relations, everyone knows what they have to do and can organize themselves freely to have the best balance in life.</p>
            <p>Thus, working time arrangements allow TeamMood employees to easily participate in family or sports activities (accompaniment to school outings for example), as well as to contribute to associative projects that are close to their hearts (repair caf√©, community Gardens, awareness workshops, etc.).</p>
            <p>This chosen flexibility enriches the exchanges and reflections on our daily work. So far, these activities focus mainly on social connection and ecology. The TeamMood team has thus been pursuing a sober approach for several years.</p>

            <p>There are no gadgets here, the computer equipment is kept to a minimum allowing you to work properly (a computer with a screen, wifi and that's it!).
            <p>The lifespan of the equipment is extended to the maximum and reconditioned is preferred as far as possible.</p>
            <p>The core TeamMood team is currently made up of 2 employees. We mainly work remotely except for one day a week. We then find ourselves in shared workspaces and favor the train for these journeys.</p>
            <p>For daily exchanges, the telephone is preferred to video, except for specific needs.</p>

            <p>On the design side, the TeamMood website was recently remodeled (2022) taking into account the eco-design recommendations given by WebVert to limit its energy impact.</p>
            <p>Regarding the application, we try to limit the functionalities to their real usefulness in a process of responding to the needs of users with minimalism. </p>
            <p>If a feature isn't used, don't keep it "just in case", we'll just reprocess it.</p>
            <p> The optimization of the application is also part of the recurring discussions (what technical choices? "refactoring"...).</p>

            <p>We want to do more.
                The question arose of how to contribute more to the ecological and social transition that we deem necessary.
                We wanted the type of initiatives carried out individually to have a collective meaning via TeamMood.</p>
            <p>Through the app? Would that perhaps take us too far away from our core business?
                Which initiative would be the most relevant?</p>
            <p>We therefore decided that in addition to the time freed up to get involved in associations for each employee,
                TeamMood would contribute financially to support actions in favor of the preservation of the environment.</p>
            <p>As soon as we can, we will communicate these actions more precisely in our blog.</p>
