    </p>

    <h2>
        Section  3. OBJECTIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
        The objective of these general terms and conditions is to define the access
        and usage rights with respect to the SOLUTION's functionalities for anyone
        called upon to access and use such rights, either by consulting the
        content, producing such content or transmitting it to specific persons.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  4. DESCRIPTION OF THE SOLUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
        TEAMMOOD anonymously collects the mood of employees, as well as their
        comments, through the exchange of text contents between USERS. Subject to
        the authorizations granted by their organization, all USERS may consult
        these contents. The SOLUTION is accessible on mobile and stationary
        equipment. TEAMMOOD provides data-hosting, and ensures the maintenance and
        security of the SOLUTION.

        TEAMMOOD is optimized to work with the following solutions:
        Google Chrome v36 and above, Firefox v42 and above, and Safari v9.0 and
        above. Clients should therefore check the configuration of their software
        tools before subscribing to the SOLUTION.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  5. NETWORK AND ACCESS TO THE SOLUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
        A connection to the Internet is required for access to the SOLUTION. POWER
        UP CONSEIL is not responsible for the proper operation of that network.
        Subject to the provisions of these GENERAL TERMS AND conditions, access to
        the SOLUTION is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including Sundays
        and holidays.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  6. SECURITY AND ACCESS TO THE SOLUTION
    </h2>
    <p>
        The registration process is subject to prior acceptance of these general
        terms and conditions. Access to the SOLUTION is secured by a password
        assigned to the USER, who agrees to keep it confidential. The USER is
        entirely responsible for the security information transmitted to him (her)
        and is responsible for its confidentiality. Such information may only be
        modified at his (her) request. A USER who loses his (her) identifiers or
        who notices illegal use of such identifiers shall immediately notify POWER
        UP CONSEIL thereof.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  7. EQUIPMENT PROTECTION
    </h2>
    <p>
        The USER shall be liable for the protection of the equipment enabling his
        (her) access to the SOFTWARE and ensuring the preservation of his (her)
        data against any malicious attack. POWER UP CONSEIL shall not be liable for
        damages to the USER's equipment and/or data through the Internet network or
        otherwise.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  8. QUALITY OF SERVICES
    </h2>
    <p>
        The USER acknowledges that the Internet network may be subject to
        interruptions and/or operation slowdowns and that POWER UP CONSEIL may not
        be held liable thereof. Therefore, POWER UP CONSEIL is unable to guarantee
        the continuity of the use of the SOLUTION.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  9. SUSPENSION OF SERVICES
    </h2>
    <p>
        Access to the SOLUTION or any of its functionalities may occasionally be
        suspended to allow interventions and maintenance required to ensure the
        proper operation of the software. POWER UP CONSEIL shall not be liable for
        any consequences related to the unavailability of the service as a result
        of a maintenance operation or an update of the services.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  10. PRICING
    </h2>
    <p>
        The subscription shall be paid, in advance, on a monthly or an annual
        basis. The rates are based on the number of users. Payment shall be due for
        any month underway. No prorated refund shall be made in the event of a
        subscription cancellation. Except for a 30-day trial period, your
        subscription price may be adjusted upward or downward at the end of each
        billing cycle, based on changes requested. Rates are likely to change.
        Information regarding pricing is available at any time at <a href="https://www.teammood.com/en/pricing">https://www.teammood.com/en/pricing</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section 11. CANCELLATION
    </h2>
    <p>
        The TEAMMOOD subscription may be cancelled at any time through your
        account's administration console. As indicated under section 10, no
        prorated refund is made during a subscription period and payment is due for
        any month underway. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, you
        acknowledge that you have been advised that all data generated during your
        subscription period will be destroyed at the end of such period.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Section  12. USER LICENSE
    </h2>
    <p>
        The user license includes a right to access the SOFTWARE and to use it
        within the limits of the authorizations granted, including, for the
        MANAGERIAL STAFF, a right of access to the analysis functionalities of the
        contents generated by the USERS.

        Section  13. DATA PROCESSING
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Section  13.1 Definition of the PD PROCESSOR
    </h3>
    <p>
        <strong>
            The LICENSEE acknowledges that POWER UP CONSEIL does not process the PD
            in its name and/or on its own behalf
        </strong>
        . TEAMMOOD is, however, able to provide access to the functionalities of
        its SOFTWARE through this contract. These terms and conditions therefore
        define the liabilities of POWER UP CONSEIL and of the LICENSEE    in light of all the legal provisions regarding the
        protection of personal data, and are designed to inform anyone whose PD is
        being collected and processed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The LICENSEE declares and agrees that:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            it alone determines the purposes and means of PD processing
        </li>
        <li>
            it is and remains solely responsible for the PROCESSING completed
            through TEAMWOOD
        </li>
        <li>
            it is solely responsible for the legal consequences resulting directly
            or indirectly from litigation, disputes and/or liability commitments
            related to the PROCESSING of PD
        </li>
        <li>
            it is required to respond to individuals' rights regarding their PD
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
        Section  13.2 Contract WITH TEAMMOOD REQUIRED for subcontracting THE
        processing of data
    </h3>
    <p>
        If the LICENSEE wishes to ask POWER UP CONSEIL to process its PD, it shall
        do so with a duly signed contract between the parties, based on section
        28.3 of the GDPR:
        <em>
            "Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other
            legal act (...) that is binding on the processor with regard to the
            controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the
            processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of
            personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and
            rights of the controller (&#8230;)"
        </em>
        ).
    </p>
    <p>
        In the absence of a specific contract, the LICENSEE expressly waives POWER
        UP CONSEIL's liability for any legal consequences directly or indirectly
        related to litigation, disputes and/or commitments in connection with the
        PROCESSING of PD.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Section  13.3 LIABILITY limitations for TEAMMOOD
    </h3>
    <p>
        If no misconduct on the part of POWER UP CONSEIL is found in a final
        judgment, which is unlikely to be appealed, the LICENSEE shall fully
        release POWER UP CONSEIL, on demand, against all harmful legal and
        financial consequences it may suffer directly or indirectly as a result of
        a violation of legal and/or regulatory obligations related to the
        protection of PD.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Section  13.4 Duty of TEAMMOOD to inform, advise and warn LICENSEE
    </h3>
    <p>
        POWER UP CONSEIL provides the software and informational tools that enable
        the LICENSEE to comply with the GDPR provisions. Should the LICENSEE,
        however, identify a technical problem possibly involving the violation of
        one or several provisions of the GDPR, it may seek TEAMMOOD's support at

        Section  13.5 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE DATA PROTECTION REGULATION
    </h3>

        Under the laws in force, the LICENSEE acts as controller of the data it
        uses. The LICENSEE hereby declares to POWER UP CONSEIL that it has filled
